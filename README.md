Primitive full-stack app made within the tutorial at https://github.com/Primitive-Learning-Projects/mdn-local-library-project, from which pretty much all the code in this repository comes.

Taught me to make a basic full-stack app incorporating Express.js for the backend, a MongoDB accessed using the Mongoose ODM, PugJS for the views in the frontend and deployment on Railway.app (although it's no longer hosted).
